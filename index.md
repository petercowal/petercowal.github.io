Hi!  I'm Peter, a composer/programmer currently pursuing a mathematics PhD at Oregon State University.
I study numerical methods for problems in linear algebra as well as machine learning.  In the past I've also studied inverse problems in medical imaging.

This site currently documents a few of the personal projects I've worked on over the past few years.
You can check out my [games here](https://petet.itch.io "itch.io") and [music here](https://soundcloud.com/retropetet "soundcloud").
